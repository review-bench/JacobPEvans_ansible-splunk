# Ansible Splunk Enterprise

Deploy and configure Splunk Enterprise on a Proxmox VM.

## Container Strategy: Docker (Exception)

Splunk runs in Docker on a dedicated VM (VMID 200) — this is a deliberate
exception to the global LXC-first rule (see `~/git/CLAUDE.md` Container
Deployment Rules).

**Why Docker:** Splunk Enterprise's official deployment model is Docker
(`splunk/splunk` image). There is no supported native install path. The
`splunk_docker` role manages the container lifecycle via Docker Compose.

**Implication:** New features and integrations target Docker Compose on
the Splunk VM. Do not propose LXC migration or new Docker containers
for ancillary services — those belong in `ansible-proxmox-apps` as LXC.

## This Repo Owns

- Splunk Enterprise container deployment (Docker Compose on Proxmox VM)
- HEC (HTTP Event Collector) configuration
- Custom index creation and retention
- Technology Add-ons (TAs) and Splunkbase apps
- MCP Server integration (app 7931)

## Critical Constraints

- **Firewall disabled**: Guest firewall is off
  (`splunk_docker_firewall_enabled: false`). Docker DNAT conflicts with
  iptables FORWARD chain. Proxmox firewall is sole network security
  (see `terraform-proxmox/modules/firewall/`).
- **HEC tokens**: Deterministic via
  `uuidv5(HEC_NAMESPACE, "splunk-hec-<index_name>")`.
  One index = one token. Namespace UUID stored in Doppler.
- **HEC transport**: HTTPS (Splunk Docker image default, SSL enabled).
- **Secrets**: All via Doppler (`doppler run --`).
